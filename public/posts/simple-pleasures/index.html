				<p>I know. It&rsquo;s been a month since I wrote, and that last one doesn&rsquo;t even count. Since then, I spent 10 exhausting yet amazing days home in Los Angeles and then another week battling jet lag while getting settled in Croatia. We&rsquo;re staying in Cavtat, a small coastal town at Croatia&rsquo;s southern tip. The city is full of tourists, and you can&rsquo;t really blame &lsquo;em. With dozens of seafood restaurants, strikingly clear blue water, and daily sunsets that flood the sky with color; Cavtat is the perfect place to spend a summer vacation. And you can only really come in the summer. The city quite literally shuts down from November to March when the usually warm sun goes into hibernation.</p>
<p>On a quiet night last week, my stomach growls at me as I walk along the Adriatic Sea looking for a place to eat. I sit down just after sunset, a bit impatient having been rejected — there were no open tables — by my restaurant of choice. Tired from a long day exploring the walled city of Dubrovnik under 95°F heat, I grab the menu already on my table and have a look.</p>
<p>A minute later, a waitress greets me with a smile and asks if I&rsquo;d like something to drink. Since the menu only lists beer, I ask about the wine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red or white?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red.&rdquo; She begins to describe the qualities of a local red wine, but I&rsquo;m not really listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much for a glass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;24 kuna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having already looked at TripAdvisor reviews, I order the touted beef risotto. She gives me a big smile and says &ldquo;Great choice!&rdquo;. Throughout this usually boring interaction, she carries herself with a quiet exuberance that is infectious.</p>
<p>I begin to sip my wine — which tastes like a California Cab — enjoying the fact that it&rsquo;s actually warm. I&rsquo;m not sure why, but most restaurants over the last few months have served chilled red wine. I&rsquo;m not a fan.</p>
<p>Amidst the patio chatter, a familiar song plays. I couldn&rsquo;t tell you its name, but it&rsquo;s unmistakably the powerful voice of Rob Thomas. As a good friend of mine will tell you, &ldquo;Rob&rsquo;s voice in-concert sounds exactly like it does on records!&rdquo; Apparently, I state this emphatically whenever someone plays his songs.</p>
<p>As I savor my risotto, I notice a girl, maybe 5 years old, looking over at me from the table in front. I offer her a quick smile.</p>
<p>Without flinching, she smiles right back with THE warmest smile. I obviously can&rsquo;t contain returning an even bigger smile.</p>
<p>This has never happened. Most often when I respond to a kid&rsquo;s gaze with a smile, they quickly look away. Somehow, I had passed my waitress&rsquo; joy to this beautiful little girl. And she had given it right back to me.</p>
<p>After we exchange a couple more fun glances, her family pays their bill and gets up to leave. As the girl walks by me, I smile one last time, and she sends it right back with a smile that just melts my heart.</p>
<p>This little girl and I never spoke one word to each other — and we&rsquo;ll certainly never cross paths again — but I&rsquo;ll never forget her smile and how it made me feel.</p>
<p>As I process what&rsquo;s happened, I narrate a potential blog post in my head. This isn&rsquo;t uncommon for me but often happens while I&rsquo;m in the shower or somewhere else that I can&rsquo;t easily write. And by the time I do find a computer, the spark is gone. Deciding not to let that happen, I reach into my backpack, grab my journal, and over the next 15 minutes, write basically this entire post.</p>
<p>Ready to leave, I flag down my waitress to request the bill. I&rsquo;ve learned that in Europe, unless you ask for the bill, they just won&rsquo;t bring it. As my waitress hands me the bill, I first ask for her name and then practice being vulnerable by telling her how great of a waitress she&rsquo;s been. She thanks me graciously and reaches out her hand to shake mine.</p>
<p>As I sip the last of my rather large glass of wine — or what my friends would call a &ldquo;Nitin pour&rdquo; — I realize how thankful I feel, not only because of this evening&rsquo;s simple pleasures, but also because of my ability to share them with you.</p>
