## Conclave

[Conclave](https://conclave-team.github.io/conclave-site/) is a real-time collaborative text editor built in JavaScript.

Intrigued by collaboration tools like Google Docs, we set out to build one from scratch. Conclave uses a *Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type (CRDT)* to make sure all users stay in-sync and *WebRTC* to allow users to communicate directly to one another without a central server. The result is a private and secure way for users to collaborate. 

Read our [case study](https://conclave-team.github.io/conclave-site/) to learn how we built it from scratch.

## My Lists

*My Lists* was the first web app I ever wrote, and I still use it today to keep track of the [movies](https://nitinsavant.herokuapp.com/lists/movies) and [books](https://nitinsavant.herokuapp.com/lists/books) that I've enjoyed.
