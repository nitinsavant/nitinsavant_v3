For my year abroad, I'm attempting to travel light while staying prepared for different situations with regards to weather, laundry, pickpockets, etc. I did tons of research, but after just one day in Prague, I realized that it was mostly a waste. Months of googling was quickly trumped by one day of actual experience. On the bright side, with a duffel that's literally the maximum size allowed for a carry-on, I was able to get by without checking any bags.

I stuffed all clothes and most accessories into the duffel. The laptop, books, and some smaller accessories were left for the backpack. Duffel ended up weighing 12+ kg, or more than 2 kg over the carry-on limit, but who's counting?
