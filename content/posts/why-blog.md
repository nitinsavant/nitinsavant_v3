This blog is both for me and you. By writing regularly, I hope to grow as a writer. More importantly, I hope to learn about myself, the world, and the people in it. Along the way, I hope to provide you with entertainment and perhaps some insight. Lots of hope.

I purposely kept the site's design simple and bare. Without the bells and whistles of many websites, we can focus on the words.

To kick things off, here's a quote from the late musician Margaret Young:

>'Often people attempt to live their lives backwards: they try to have more things, or more money, in order to do more of what they want so that they will be happier. The way it actually works is the reverse. You must first be who you really are, then do what you need to do, in order to have what you want.' ~Margaret Young
