On June 1st, I'm leaving the country for a year. The plan is to spend one month in twelve different cities across the world. The trip includes 75 others and is organized by [Remote Year](http://remoteyear.com). Here's where we'll be from June 2015 - May 2016:

* Prague, Czech Republic *(Jun)*
* Ljubljana, Slovenia *(Jul)*
* Cavtat, Croatia *(Aug)*
* Istanbul, Turkey *(Sep)*
* Penang, Malaysia *(Oct)*
* Ko Pha Ngan, Thailand *(Nov)*
* Hanoi, Vietnam *(Dec)*
* Kyoto, Japan *(Jan)*
* Buenos Aires, Argentina *(Feb)*
* Montevideo, Uruguay *(Mar)*
* Santiago, Chile *(Apr)*
* Lima, Peru *(May)*

When I describe my trip to friends, many respond initially out of fear, while others are able to respond with joy.

Fear:

* "How do you think this will affect your career?"
* "Do you have travel insurance?"
* "Make sure to not drink the water."

Joy:

* "This is the best decision of your life."
* "I'm so excited for you."
* "Have all the fun in the world. This is the right thing to do."

I get it. I'm one of those people who watches a movie and worries about what terrible thing will happen next. When Reese Witherspoon was gently petting a horse in *Wild*, I wasn't appreciating the connection she was feeling towards her horse-loving mom. Instead, I was scared that the horse might snap and kick her.
