On a random night a few months ago, I asked my roommate how many movies he thought he'd watched in his life. Fast forward four hours, it's 2AM, my roommate is fast asleep, and I finish the list. I like making lists; there's something about making a list that's fun. Before you click below, take a guess at how many movies you've watched in your life.
