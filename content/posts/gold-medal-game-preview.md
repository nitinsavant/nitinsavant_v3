* Team USA has been sometimes inconsistent but mostly dominant on their way to the Gold Medal game.

* Kobe had a terrific offensive game versus Australia as the U.S. blew them out after a strong 3rd quarter.

* In the semi-final Argentina, Team USA came out strong leading by 20 after the first quarter. They put on cruise control somewhat but were in command throughout with Argentina only threatening once.

* Luis Scola played the best game against the USA that anyone has played this Olympics. He was very sneaky and skillful underneath and Team USA had trouble containing him.

* Now on to Spain. This will be the toughest game of the tournament.

* I believe Spain held back somewhat in their group play game with USA, expecting to meet them again in the Gold Medal game.

* It appears that their best guard, Jose Calderon, will miss the game. This severely diminishes Spain's already low chances of victory. But, they can pull it out if the USA cannot find their range and Spain plays almost perfectly.

* Spain has the most talented team besides the USA and they match up decently (it's impossible for any team to match up well).

* Lebron James is scary good. I cannot wait to see what he is going to be like in 4 years, the middle of his prime. He has the ability to be the best basketball player ever. If he develops a consistent jump shot and 3-ball, he will have no trouble scoring 100 points in a game. 

* I apologize for the lack of updates, but I just moved and it has been difficult to post. Will have another update following the Gold Medal game. I 'boldly' predicted a gold medal for the USA earlier this month and I stand by that prediction.
